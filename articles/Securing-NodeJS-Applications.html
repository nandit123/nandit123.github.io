    <h3>Securing NodeJS Applications</h3>
    <p>Increasingly NodeJS is being used by more and more people. Many companies have their 
        backend written in nodejs for either their Websites, API, etc. Also, Javascript is
        being seen as a universal language now a days since it can be used to develop frontend of 
        the websites (using frameworks like react.js, angular, vue.js), native apps - ios and android
        (using react native, ionic, Native script), for VR apps  (using react VR). Some people are
        also using js for machine learning, neural networks (Brain.js) but still its a long road to go 
        in that domain. Now the backend of your apps can be built using NodeJS and is very suitable for
        development of APIs and microservices.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Given said that, many developers and companies would prefer Javascript and related frameworks
        and NodeJS since multiple work gets done using one language only. Now lets talk about making 
        your NodeJS backend secure. I will quicky walk you through the key steps you require to do that
        without having much expertise in cyber security.
    </p>
    <h4><strong>1. Use HelmetJS</strong></h4>
    <p>Use this to quicky set up headers so that the browsers can use their inbuilt functionality
        to protect your app.
    </p>
    <p>Install it using </p>
    <code>npm install helmet --save</code>
    <p><br>Then in an express app, add the following</p>
    <pre>
        const express = require('express') 
        const helmet = require('helmet') 
        const app = express()
    </pre>
    <p><br>then to use helmet's functionality use the follwing. hidePoweredBy is to confuse the 
    person trying to understand what language your website is written in. for others headers read
    the official documentation.</p>
    <pre>
        app.use(helmet({
            hidePoweredBy: { setTo: 'Python-59' },
            frameguard: {action: 'deny'},
            xssFilter: true,
            noSniff: true, 
            ieNoOpen: true, 
            hsts: {maxAge: ninetyDaysInMilliseconds},
            dnsPrefetchControl: false,
        }));
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p>
        The <code>app.use(helmet(...))</code> can be used to to include all the functionalities except,
        the noCache() and contentSecurityPolicy() which can be implemented as follows. Refer the
        HelmetJS documentation to setup content security policy as per your need and setup others
        headers. =>
    </p>
    <pre>
        app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
            directives: {
                defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
                scriptSrc: ["'self'", "trusted-cdn.com"]
            }
        }));

        app.use(helmet.noCache());
    </pre>
